# Gunner
Fighter Jet Game; clone of [Strike Gunner S.T.G.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_Gunner_S.T.G.). You can always get the nightly build [here](https://github.com/thebigG/Gunner/releases/tag/Gunner-continuous-release).

## Sound Credits
"Explosion, 8-bit, 01.wav" by InspectorJ (www.jshaw.co.uk) of Freesound.org

## Building

To build the game from source(or "export" it from godot), you must use my own [custom version of godot](https://github.com/thebigG/godot-3.x-modules).
