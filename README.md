# Gunner 
Fighter Jet Game; clone of [Strike Gunner S.T.G.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_Gunner_S.T.G.). You can always get the nightly build [here](https://github.com/thebigG/Gunner/releases/tag/continuous-build).  
Though the game will probably provide the best experience via the desktop native builds, you can always play it on the [web](https://thebigg.github.io/Gunner/Gunner.html).

## Building

To build the game from source(or "export" it from godot), you must use my own [custom version of godot](https://github.com/thebigG/godot-3.x-modules).
